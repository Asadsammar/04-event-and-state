## Question 3,4
What is the purpose of this writing key={to.email}?< Chat key={to.email} contact={to} / >
What is the function of keythese props?
## Answer
The key prop in React is a special attribute used to give elements a stable identity during dynamic changes. In the <Chat key={to.email} contact={to} /> component, it helps React identify which Chat component to update when the selected contact changes, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders. Essentially, itâ€™s a tool for React to efficiently manage lists and UI state transitions.
